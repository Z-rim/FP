In this project, I would be making a game called, avoid the red. And avoid the red you as a player will be playing as a blue box and you rejected it is to find your way to the green box at the same time avoiding the red boxes each time a player hits the red box. It will close the game and you will need to start over and there would be 10 levels, and it would be getting harder and harder to time. The purpose of this project is to entertain the user. Why I chose this game is I want him to make something entertaining but at the same time something that is not too complicated.
My team name will be GDO
